This directory contains files to perform certain devops commands using Python and Linux from the command line.  

show_version.py instructions:
Update the device information (host ip, username, password) in the hosts.yaml file and when you run the show_version.py file the script will SSH into the device and return the requesed command.  The code in show_version.py can be updated to run other show commands on a Cisco device over an SSH session. 

I will be updating this reponsitory as time goes on.  Check back for more updates!
